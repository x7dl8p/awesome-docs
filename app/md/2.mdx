Welcome to the blockchain integration guide for our documentation site. Follow these steps to set up your environment and start building decentralized applications with our blockchain tools.

## Installation

To install our blockchain package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @our-company/blockchain-sdk

## Configuration

After installation, you need to set up the configuration file. Create a file named `config.js` in your project root and add the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  network: 'mainnet',
  privateKey: 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY',
  rpcUrl: 'https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_PROJECT_ID'
}
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use our blockchain SDK in your project:

```javascript
import { BlockchainClient } from '@our-company/blockchain-sdk';

const client = new BlockchainClient();
const balance = await client.getBalance('0xYourWalletAddress');
console.log('Balance:', balance);
```
