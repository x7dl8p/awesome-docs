Welcome to the backend development toolkit guide for our documentation site. Follow these steps to set up your environment and start building robust backend services with our development tools.

## Installation

To install our backend package, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @our-company/backend-framework
```

## Configuration

After installation, you need to set up the configuration file. Create a file named `config.js` in your project root and add the following content:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  databaseUrl: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/myapp',
  port: 8080,
  jwtSecret: 'YOUR_JWT_SECRET'
}
```

## Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use our backend framework in your project:

```javascript
import { Server } from '@our-company/backend-framework';

const server = new Server();
server.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ users: [] });
});
server.listen(8080);
```
